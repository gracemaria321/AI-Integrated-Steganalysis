Author: Grace Maria, Ramsha Rizwan

	The integration of AI is revolutionizing digital forensics by enhancing traditional tools with automation, speed, and advanced 
analytical capabilities to process massive and complex datasets. Major vendors like Cellebrite and Magnet Forensics are incorporating 
AI into their platforms, while specialized tools focus on specific tasks such as deepfake detection. AI and machine learning (ML) are 
applied across various stages of the digital forensic process, enabling investigators to analyze evidence more efficiently and detect 
subtle patterns. There exist both advantages and challenges when using AI in forensic tools.

	In the realm of cyber forensics, image steganography tools play a crucial role in both concealing and uncovering hidden data within digital 
images. These tools are used by forensic investigators to detect covert communication, digital tampering, or illicit data transfers. Here 
are some widely recognized tools and techniques:

Tool Name		Functionality										Format Support		Notes
---------		--------------------------------------------------	---------------		----------------------------------------------
Steghide		Embeds data in BMP and JPEG images					BMP, JPEG			Supports encryption and compression
OutGuess		Preserves statistical properties while hiding data	JPEG				Often used in forensic analysis
F5				Uses matrix encoding to reduce changes				JPEG				Known for high security and low detectability
Aletheia		Steganalysis tool for forensic detection			JPEG				Detects hidden data using statistical methods
StegExpose		Automated detection of steganography				Multiple			Combines several detection techniques
Stegdetect		Detects steganographic content in images			JPEG				Useful for batch analysis
	
Some techniques used in forensic steganalysis include
* Statistical Analysis: Examines image properties like histogram anomalies or chi-square tests to detect hidden data.
* Visual Inspection: Identifies unusual patterns or distortions in images.
* AI-Based Detection: Uses machine learning to identify steganographic signatures across large datasets.

AI-integrated steganography is revolutionizing how hidden data is embedded, detected, and protected across digital media. The fusion of machine learning or deep learning techniques with traditional steganographic methods to:
* Improve concealment quality
* Evade detection by steganalysis tools
* Adapt to different media types (images, text, audio, 3D models)

AI isn’t just used to hide data—it’s also used to detect it:
* Deep residual networks like SRNet are fine-tuned to uncover hidden patterns in stego-images
* However, AI-generated stego-media can be trained to evade these detectors, creating a cat-and-mouse dynamic.
