Presented: 2024 ICORIS conference

Purpose of the Study
The paper compares traditional steganography techniques—like Least Significant Bit (LSB) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)—with 
modern AI-based methods, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The goal is 
to evaluate their effectiveness in hiding data within images while resisting detection.

---------   ------------------------------------------      -----------------------------------------   -----------------------------------
LSB         Embeds data in the least significant bits       Simple, low distortion                      Easily detectable, format-sensitive
            of image pixels
DCT         Embeds data in frequency domain coefficients    High image fidelity, robust to compression  Computationally heavier
CNN         Learns patterns for embedding and detecting     Adaptive, good concealment                  Requires training, moderate quality
            hidden data
GAN         Generator-discriminator model creates           High resistance to detection                Lower image quality, resource-intensive
            realistic stego-images

Evaluation Metrics
* PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio): Measures image quality after embedding
* SSIM (Structural Similarity Index): Assesses structural similarity to original image
* Detection Accuracy: Measures how easily hidden data can be detected

Key Findings
* DCT had the highest PSNR (up to 96.954) and SSIM (near 1.0), making it best for maintaining image quality.
* GANs produced realistic images with moderate PSNR (8.341–14.740) and SSIM (0.199–0.812), but excelled in detection evasion.
* CNNs showed stable detection accuracy (~43%) and better performance on PNG images than JPG.
* LSB varied widely in quality and detection accuracy, with PNG outperforming JPG.

Experimental Setup
* Used a sneaker image dataset in JPG and PNG formats.
* Embedded binary messages using each method.
* Evaluated visual quality and detection resistance using machine learning classifiers.

Conclusions
* DCT is ideal for high-quality image preservation and accurate detection.
* GANs and CNNs offer better stealth but require more computational power.
* PNG format consistently outperformed JPG in preserving quality and resisting detection.
* The choice of method should balance image fidelity, detection resistance, and computational cost.
